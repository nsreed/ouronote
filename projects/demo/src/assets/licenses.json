In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Just Angular.\r\n\r\nIt works with angular version 2.0.0 and up\r\n\r\nTo make more sense with the future versioning scheme of Angular, the directive selector is now rename to **ngxClipboard**\r\n\r\n## Other packages\r\n\r\n-   [ngx-progressive-image-loader](https://github.com/maxisam/ngx-progressive-image-loader): it can lazy load img/picture, prevent reflow and seo friendly.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n - If you need to use it on 2.x, please use version 7.x.x.\r\n - If you need to use it on 4.x, please use version 8.x.x.\r\n - If you need to use it on 5.x, please use version 10.x.x.\r\n - If you need to use it on 8.x, please use version 12.x.x.\r\n - If you need to use it on 9.x, please use version 13.x.x.\r\n\r\nThe code are pretty much the same, in v8.0.0 it uses InjectionToken which requires angular4 and above.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nYou can get it on npm.\r\n\r\n```bat\r\nnpm install ngx-clipboard --save\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen your module file e.g `app.module.ts` and update **imports** array\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { ClipboardModule } from 'ngx-clipboard';\r\n...\r\nimports: [\r\n...\r\n    ClipboardModule,\r\n...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIf you use SystemJS to load your files, you might have to update your config:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nSystem.config({\r\n    map: {\r\n        'ngx-clipboard': 'node_modules/ngx-clipboard'\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Copy source\r\n\r\nThis library support multiple kinds of copy source.\r\n\r\n-   Setting `cbContent` attribute\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button ngxClipboard [cbContent]=\"'target string'\">Copy</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can assign the parent **container** to avoid focus trapper issue, #145\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div #container>\r\n    <button ngxClipboard [cbContent]=\"'target string'\" [container]=\"container\">Copy</button>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n-   Setting an input target\r\n\r\n```html\r\n....\r\n\r\n<input type=\"text\" #inputTarget />\r\n\r\n<button [ngxClipboard]=\"inputTarget\">Copy</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n-   Using `copy` from `ClipboardService` to copy any text you dynamically created.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { ClipboardService } from 'ngx-clipboard'\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nconstructor(private _clipboardService: ClipboardService){\r\n...\r\n}\r\n\r\ncopy(text: string){\r\n  this._clipboardService.copy(text)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Callbacks\r\n\r\n-   `cbOnSuccess` callback attribute is triggered after copy was successful with `$event: {isSuccess: true, content: string}`\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button (cbOnSuccess)=\"copied($event)\" [cbContent]=\"'example string'\">Copied</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr updating parameters directly like so\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button (cbOnSuccess)=\"isCopied = true\" [cbContent]=\"'example string'\">Copied</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n-   `cbOnError` callback attribute is triggered when there's failure in copying with `$event:{isSuccess: false}`\r\n\r\n### Conditionally render host\r\n\r\nYou can also use the structural directive \\*ngxClipboardIfSupported to conditionally render the host element\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button ngxClipboard *ngxClipboardIfSupported [cbContent]=\"'target string'\" (cbOnSuccess)=\"isCopied = true\">\r\n    Copy\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Special thanks to @surajpoddar16 for implementing this feature_\r\n\r\n### Handle copy response globally\r\n\r\nTo handle copy response globally, you can subscribe to `copyResponse$` exposed by the `ClipboardService`\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class ClipboardResponseService {\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private _clipboardService: ClipboardService,\r\n    private _toasterService: ToasterService\r\n  ) {\r\n    this.handleClipboardResponse();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  handleClipboardResponse() {\r\n    this._clipboardService.copyResponse$.subscribe((res: IClipboardResponse) => {\r\n      if (res.isSuccess) {\r\n        this._toasterService.pop('success', undefined, res.successMessage);\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Special thanks to @surajpoddar16 for implementing this feature_\r\n\r\n### Clean up temporary textarea used by this module after each copy to clipboard\r\n\r\nThis library creates a textarea element at the root of the body for its internal use. By default it only destroys it when the directive is destroyed. If you'd like it to be destroyed after each copy to clipboard, provide root level module configuration like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nClipboardService.configure({ cleanUpAfterCopy: true });\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to [@DmitryEfimenko](https://github.com/DmitryEfimenko) for implementing this feature\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n[stackblitz.com](https://stackblitz.com/github/maxisam/ngx-clipboard)\r\n\r\n## Build project\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\nnpm i && npm run build\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run demo code locally\r\n\r\n`npm run start`\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n-   Your commits conform to the conventions established [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md)\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nPlease ask your general questions at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ngx-clipboard\r\n\r\n## Shoutouts 🙏\r\n\r\nKudos to\r\n\r\n[Thierry Templier](http://stackoverflow.com/a/36330518/667767) This project is inspired by his answer on StackOverflow.\r\n\r\nThe core function is ported from [clipboard.js](http://zenorocha.github.io/clipboard.js/) by [@zenorocha](https://twitter.com/zenorocha).\r\n\r\nThis project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/images/layout/browserstack-logo-600x315.png\" height=\"80\" title=\"BrowserStack Logo\" alt=\"BrowserStack Logo\" />\r\n\r\nBig thanks to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) for letting the maintainers use their service to debug browser issues.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n### Code Contributors\r\n\r\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.

With this module, you can use WINDOW token just like DOCUMENT token.\n\n# Breaking Change after version 5.0.0\n\nreturn undefine if window is undefine. Before, it doesn't even inject WindowToken.\n\n# Breaking Change after version 1.0.2\n\nremoved now-unnecessary `NgxWindowTokenModule`, it will be inject into root module\n\n# Breaking Change after version 1.0.0\n\nchange `WindowTokenModule` -> `NgxWindowTokenModule`\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Angular >=6.0.0\n\n## Install\n\nYou can get it on npm.\n\n```\nnpm install ngx-window-token --save\n```\n\n## Build project\n\n```\n1. npm i\n\n2. npm run build\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you use SystemJS to load your files, you might have to update your config:\n\n```js\nSystem.config({\n  map: {\n    'ngx-window-token': 'node_modules/ngx-window-token'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn your component\n\n```\n  constructor(@Inject(WINDOW) _window) { }\n```\n\nFor webpack / Angular CLI, it works as any other libraries.

If You\n    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n    as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n 4.

The contents\n        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n        as modifying the License.\n\n    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n    the conditions stated in this License.\n\n 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n    replaced with your own identifying information.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
