Just Angular.\n\nIt works with angular version 2.0.0 and up\n\nTo make more sense with the future versioning scheme of Angular, the directive selector is now rename to **ngxClipboard**\n\n## Dependencies\n\n-   If you need to use it on 2.x, please use version 7.x.x.\n-   If you need to use it on 4.x, please use version 8.x.x.\n-   If you need to use it on 5.x, please use version 10.x.x.\n-   If you need to use it on 8.x, please use version 12.x.x.\n-   If you need to use it on 9.x, please use version 13.x.x.\n-   If you need to use it on 10.x - 12.x, please use version 14.0.2.\n-   If you need to use it on 13.x, please use version 15.x.x. (Also thanks https://github.com/arturovt for updating & tuning)\n\nThe code are pretty much the same, in v8.0.0 it uses InjectionToken which requires angular4 and above.\n\n## Install\n\nYou can get it on npm.\n\n```bat\nnpm install ngx-clipboard --save\n```\n\nOpen your module file e.g `app.module.ts` and update **imports** array\n\n```ts\nimport { ClipboardModule } from 'ngx-clipboard';\n...\nimports: [\n...\n    ClipboardModule,\n...\n]\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you use SystemJS to load your files, you might have to update your config:\n\n```js\nSystem.config({\n    map: {\n        'ngx-clipboard': 'node_modules/ngx-clipboard'\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Copy source\n\nThis library support multiple kinds of copy source.\n\n-   Setting `cbContent` attribute\n\n```html\n<button ngxClipboard [cbContent]=\"'target string'\">Copy</button>\n```\n\nYou can assign the parent **container** to avoid focus trapper issue, #145\n\n```html\n<div #container>\n    <button ngxClipboard [cbContent]=\"'target string'\" [container]=\"container\">Copy</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n-   Setting an input target\n\n```html\n....\n\n<input type=\"text\" #inputTarget />\n\n<button [ngxClipboard]=\"inputTarget\">Copy</button>\n```\n\n-   Using `copy` from `ClipboardService` to copy any text you dynamically created.\n\n```ts\nimport { ClipboardService } from 'ngx-clipboard'\n\n...\n\nconstructor(private _clipboardService: ClipboardService){\n...\n}\n\ncopy(text: string){\n  this._clipboardService.copy(text)\n}\n```\n\n### Callbacks\n\n-   `cbOnSuccess` callback attribute is triggered after copy was successful with `$event: {isSuccess: true, content: string}`\n\n```html\n<button (cbOnSuccess)=\"copied($event)\" [cbContent]=\"'example string'\">Copied</button>\n```\n\nOr updating parameters directly like so\n\n```html\n<button (cbOnSuccess)=\"isCopied = true\" [cbContent]=\"'example string'\">Copied</button>\n```\n\n-   `cbOnError` callback attribute is triggered when there's failure in copying with `$event:{isSuccess: false}`\n\n### Conditionally render host\n\nYou can also use the structural directive \\*ngxClipboardIfSupported to conditionally render the host element\n\n```html\n<button ngxClipboard *ngxClipboardIfSupported [cbContent]=\"'target string'\" (cbOnSuccess)=\"isCopied = true\">\n    Copy\n</button>\n```\n\n_Special thanks to @surajpoddar16 for implementing this feature_\n\n### Handle copy response globally\n\nTo handle copy response globally, you can subscribe to `copyResponse$` exposed by the `ClipboardService`\n\n```\nexport class ClipboardResponseService {\n  constructor(\n    private _clipboardService: ClipboardService,\n    private _toasterService: ToasterService\n  ) {\n    this.handleClipboardResponse();\n  }\n\n  handleClipboardResponse() {\n    this._clipboardService.copyResponse$.subscribe((res: IClipboardResponse) => {\n      if (res.isSuccess) {\n        this._toasterService.pop('success', undefined, res.successMessage);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n_Special thanks to @surajpoddar16 for implementing this feature_\n\n### Clean up temporary textarea used by this module after each copy to clipboard\n\nThis library creates a textarea element at the root of the body for its internal use. By default it only destroys it when the directive is destroyed. If you'd like it to be destroyed after each copy to clipboard, provide root level module configuration like this:\n\n```ts\nClipboardService.configure({ cleanUpAfterCopy: true });\n```\n\nSpecial thanks to [@DmitryEfimenko](https://github.com/DmitryEfimenko) for implementing this feature\n\n## Example\n\n[stackblitz.com](https://stackblitz.com/github/maxisam/ngx-clipboard)\n\n## Build project\n\n```cmd\nnpm i && npm run build\n```\n\nTo run demo code locally\n\n`npm run start`\n\n## Contributing\n\n-   Your commits conform to the conventions established [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nPlease ask your general questions at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ngx-clipboard\n\n## Shoutouts 🙏\n\nKudos to\n\n[Thierry Templier](http://stackoverflow.com/a/36330518/667767) This project is inspired by his answer on StackOverflow.\n\nThe core function is ported from [clipboard.js](http://zenorocha.github.io/clipboard.js/) by [@zenorocha](https://twitter.com/zenorocha).\n\nThis project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/images/layout/browserstack-logo-600x315.png\" height=\"80\" title=\"BrowserStack Logo\" alt=\"BrowserStack Logo\" />\n\nBig thanks to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) for letting the maintainers use their service to debug browser issues.\n\n## Contributors\n\n### Code Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.

Before, it doesn't even inject WindowToken.\n\n# Breaking Change after version 1.0.2\n\nremoved now-unnecessary `NgxWindowTokenModule`, it will be inject into root module\n\n# Breaking Change after version 1.0.0\n\nchange `WindowTokenModule` -> `NgxWindowTokenModule`\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Angular >=6.0.0\n\n## Install\n\nYou can get it on npm.\n\n```\nnpm install ngx-window-token --save\n```\n\n## Build project\n\n```\n1. npm i\n\n2. npm run build\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you use SystemJS to load your files, you might have to update your config:\n\n```js\nSystem.config({\n  map: {\n    'ngx-window-token': 'node_modules/ngx-window-token'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn your component\n\n```\n  constructor(@Inject(WINDOW) _window) { }\n```\n\nFor webpack / Angular CLI, it works as any other libraries.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n 7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n    replaced with your own identifying information.
